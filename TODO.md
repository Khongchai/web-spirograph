Bug: Left nodes can't be dragged to the right, while right nodes always can be dragged over the left ones.... << postion alignment problem

Can now drag and drop but circles still won't rerender

BoundingCircle should be able to be used as the parent, but not child

Write tests for the generateNodes -- kinda complicated

Current cycloid should be multi-selection

Make the rerender toggle global.

A better folder structure, please.
