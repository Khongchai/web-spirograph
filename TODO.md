# In progress

- Trying to refactor everything to an offscreen-canvas (run the app and you'll know from where to continue).

## TODO

- Experiment with offscreen canvas

- Move all context provider to App.tsx.

- refactor folder structures, especially utils folder.

- New landing page

- Package it nicely by composing a music for the application.

- Save state

Write tests for the generateNodes -- kinda complicated

Make the rerender toggle global.

A better folder structure, please.

Refactor tooltip out as a wrapper so that you can use it with anything.

Instant draw

Canvas // eventlistener multi-threading for better performance. Watch out for non-atomic operations.

The ability to change colors

use another cycloid as the base for drawing.

Node as control for cycloid relationship.
