We get only those shapes you see because right now, we're outside of the circle.
Moving along the inside is like going straight, but the straight path happens to curve (maybe translate matrix or simpler, just move the cycloid inside (offset or something idk).

Also draw the outer circle >> Don't forget to rename variables to inner & outer circles

variables to control: rodlength, radiusScale, innerRotationSpeed

Adjust rod length dynamically
Adjust radius of inner circle dynamically

Watch this again and think about how you can have the user define the ratio instead:
